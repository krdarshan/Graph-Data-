Remote Equipment Monitoring & Predictive Maintenance Dashboard (Frontend Design Only)
Design a modern, visually intuitive IoT-enabled dashboard using React and Tailwind CSS to monitor real-time equipment performance. The dashboard should integrate dynamic graphs, status indicators, alerts, and interactive UI components to provide actionable insights for predictive maintenance.

Core Features & Sections:
âœ… Sidebar Navigation: A clean, collapsible sidebar with categorized menu items (Dashboard, Fuel Consumption, Operating Hours, Settings, History, etc.).
âœ… Search & Notifications: A top navigation bar with a search function and an anomaly detection notification system for real-time issue alerts.
âœ… Predictive Maintenance Insights: A central section showing real-time vibration levels, failure predictions, and abnormality detection with clear trend graphs.
âœ… Interactive Data Visualizations:

Bar charts for historical performance comparison.
Donut/pie charts for equipment status distribution (Active, Faulty, Warning).
Line charts for trend analysis of metrics like fuel consumption and operating hours.
âœ… Maintenance Alerts & Reports: Sections highlighting upcoming maintenance needs with report buttons for deeper insights.
âœ… Equipment Status Overview: A section displaying key metrics like vibration frequency, fuel usage, operating hours, and temperature with colored indicators for normal vs. abnormal states.
âœ… Live Status Updates: Real-time numerical and graphical data representation showing live equipment health, changes over time, and percentage comparisons with past data.
Design & User Experience:
ðŸš€ Sleek, minimalistic, and professional UI with a light theme and soft colors for clarity.
